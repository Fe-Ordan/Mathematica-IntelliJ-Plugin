/**
 * TODO: Rewrite comment
 * Provides the functionality of resolving local references. This means, this class takes care to find out where a local
 * variable was defined and it can be used to find all references of a variable inside a scope. "Local" in this context
 * means that the variable must be localized with Module, Block, Table, Compile, etc..
 *
 *
 * This class is for instance used by  but to give an overview of a complete flow let me
 * explain this in more detail:
 *
 *
 * Let's assume you have "Preferences" -> "Editor" -> "Highlight usages of symbol under cursor" turned on and when you
 * browse through the code and stop on a variable, the variable itself and all its usages are highlighted. The moment
 * you move the cursor over the variable, IDEA calls [Symbol.getReference] in order to find the place where this
 * variable is defined. The  first finds the correct PsiElement for which the reference should
 * be searched. Usually, this is always the [Symbol] over which the cursor is.
 *
 *
 * Now  searches clever for the place where the variable could be defined. This
 * process depends on the language; in Mathematica, I use currently the following approach: I walk the parsing tree
 * upwards and check every Module, Block, ... I find on my way. Checking means I look in the definition list whether my
 * variable is defined there. If not, I go further upwards. This is why you find a [ ][PsiTreeUtil.treeWalkUp] in this method. On every step
 * upwards the [.execute] method is called and exactly here I extract all locally
 * defined variables I find and check whether any of it has the same name as my original variable whose definition I
 * want to find.
 *
 *
 * If I find it in any of the localization constructs like Module, Block.. I stop and return the PsiElement which is the
 * place of definition.
 *
 *
 * Finding all usages works btw the same way: First I find the definition of a variable and then I find all variables
 * which resolve to the exact same place of definition.
